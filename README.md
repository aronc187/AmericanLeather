leather selling company


This website has 6 pages and used javascript, php and mysql. The first section of the website is the index.php page which has simple layout with images, buttons and icons.
The navbar has 4 menu options which are home, about, catalog, and contact. IN the about page is simply a article discribing what the company is about along with a video. The
catalog is not a page but a drop down menu that has men, women, and accessories. These menu options are pages that lead to a page full of products. The contact page is just
a contact form for customer inquiries (uses mysql for submissions). Also the website uses css/animations/gifs/javascript for the loading page, and for my database I used php to execute queries for the forms.
